# INET4031 - Module 4 - Website Lab

This repository contains my lab work for Module 4 of INET4031.  

As such, the purpose of this repository is to demonstrate basic use of **HTML** and **JavaScript** to create a simple interactive webpage. What you'll see is that the webpage will display a lightbulb image that can be turned on and off with buttons. Essentially this lab shows how JavaScript can change HTML attributes in response to user interaction, in a way it's like adding paint to a blank canvas or adding in more personality.
