# INET4031 - Module 4 - Website Lab

This repository contains my lab work for Module 4 of INET4031.  
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate basic use of **HTML** and **JavaScript** to create a simple interactive webpage.  

What you'll see is that the webpage will display a lightbulb image that can be turned on and off with buttons.  
Essentially this lab shows how JavaScript can change HTML attributes in response to user interaction.
